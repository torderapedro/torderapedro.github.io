                <p>
                    The San Jerónimo neighborhood, the northernmost in Seville, is the setting for the project. 
                    The concept begins with a cascaded design analysis: <strong>neighborhood</strong> —L scale—, <strong>surroundings</strong> —M scale—, and
					<strong>building</strong> —S scale—, which seeks to build a coherent narrative across all scales.
                </p>

                <h2>A Socio-Ecological Infrastructure</h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, a strategy of <strong>gap detection</strong> is defined, seeking not only degraded spaces, but also those that 
                    already function as activity hubs, which will support obsolete and abandoned areas to form a new weave of spaces in the neighborhood.
				</p>

				<p>
                    Subsequently, a layer-identification methodology is followed, forming a <strong>palimpsest</strong>. The layers considered relevant are the current state,
                    existing vegetation, past state, traces of the past, first-level landmarks, second-level landmarks, detected gaps, and 
                    contextual situations. This process allows for the generation of a richer base, which is in itself a statement of intent regarding what should carry the most weight in design decisions.

                    With this in mind, the idea emerged—through sketches—of an element that could be inserted into the entire environment at once, capable of growing
                    and evolving over time. An <strong>infrastructure</strong> capable of settling upon a specific terrain with its own archaeology, responding
                    to the complete program through a <strong>hybridization of uses</strong>. The construction itself is designed to extend and generate residential
                    buildings, as well as the youth center, and, in the future, possible expansions to the north or even modularly towards the park.
                    This is where the layer of contextual situations appears, translated into grids that
                    are oriented according to the adjacent voids and pathways where the organism could grow. Therefore, naming it <strong>situated infrastructure</strong>
                    underlines the intended influence in the areas near the main plot,
                    an organism capable of deploying complementary pieces to other spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach is considered—in my personal view—essential in contemporary architecture, an attitude applied to a society of constant change.
                    An infrastructure capable of existing temporarily and for a specific time, of functioning in parts and as a whole, of growing and
                    shrinking as necessary. To meet these premises, the construction systems themselves must allow for quick,
                    simple, and reusable assembly, to the greatest extent possible.
                </p>

                <h2>The Youth Center</h2>
                <p>
                    The floor plan of the youth center is organized based on main axes, as outlined in previous diagrams,
                    which correspond to existing elements, such as the paths from the park towards the neighborhood or the lines of the English Cemetery.
                </p>
                <p>
	                The <strong>ground floor</strong>, integrated into the proposed public park route, establishes the main access level from the street.
                    It accommodates the noisiest uses and those susceptible to participation in the exterior space at elevation +0.00m. This floor is fragmented into three volumes.
                    The south volume, which has its main entrance from Calle Cataluña, houses the lobby, reception and administration, a multipurpose room that 
                    will host temporary exhibitions, among other uses, and an auditorium for events and conferences, in addition to two restroom cores. The north volume 
                    consists of multipurpose classrooms, for teaching workshops, classes, and courses of all kinds (manual, theoretical, interactive), and
                    two other restroom cores. Finally, a third volume corresponds to the cafeteria and cooking workshop use. By
                    fragmenting these volumes, they allow for independent operation; that is, any one can function without depending on the others; and in a
                    realistic situation, the main volume (south) will always be in operation, with the other two varying according to their programming.
                    It is also worth mentioning that uses dependent on loading and unloading are prioritized on this floor. These spaces orbit the voids borrowed 
                    by the infrastructure, being connected to each other through the main axes that, on this floor, become public space, 
                    freeing up transit while establishing certain control points.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The public space on this floor is organized through its <strong>afforestation</strong> (*bosquificación*).
                    Areas of dense vegetation are created, aiming to provide shade—in the future—over the proposed route.
                    The strategy, as already mentioned, is based on the recovery of old routes, organizing the plot through the weave of voids
                    generated by the vegetation. These voids are also fed by nearby landmarks, even influencing the toponymy and taking their names:
                    Noria Square, Cemetery Square, etc.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The <strong>first floor</strong> closes the volume of the ground floor voids and houses quiet, tranquil, and independent uses.
                    The south volume continues as a library with different rooms, and the north volume repeats the distribution of classrooms intended for support classes,
                    languages, and other educational and guidance topics for young people.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    A public space is proposed on the first floor, acting as a <strong>link</strong> between the residential complexes and the youth center.
                    This corresponds to the main longitudinal axis traced on the ground floor. Areas for staying, shade, and a small planting zone are planned.
                    Furthermore, from this floor there is access to the maintenance stairs for the roofs and also to the reserved installation spaces,
                    which are at the first-floor level, avoiding the placement of machinery on the vegetated roof.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <strong>basement floor</strong> is located in the northern part of the plot, linked to uses that require a freight elevator for comfortable loading and
                    unloading. The basement opens towards the interior courtyard, which slopes towards it to naturally ventilate and illuminate the space,
                    as well as connecting it via stairs on this slope.
